# Studydy final architecture

Production has one semantic path:

```text
來源檔案 → 本機轉為 PDF → native Evidence → sections + source bundle
    → resident Gemma 4 unified semantics → deterministic projection
    → Document Tree + canonical Concepts + typed Relations + Initial Path
    → StudySession + AssessmentSet + AnswerEvent
```

Supplementary resource recommendation (Agent 2) is removed. Concepts retain only the uploaded
material's Evidence and PDF locators. Source-bound Knowledge Structure and its public view use schema v4/v3, with
no resource-library fields or separate resource PDF kind. Fresh pre-release databases use the
initial migration followed by additive learner-credentials and material-name migrations; historical evaluation
artifacts remain separate and are not rewritten.

Gemma 4 owns Concept boundaries, Claim meaning, cross-section consolidation, Relation proposals/reasons,
and Assessment semantics. Code owns source identity, Evidence/span binding, exact technical literals,
schema, ownership, endpoints, duplicates/conflicts, prerequisite cycles, private answers, scoring,
and stale/idempotency/concurrency behavior.

教材 worker 在初始語意分析後執行 [檢核與整理](material-review.md)，再發布 canonical 地圖。
它共用既有 semantic transport；既有教材可重用已保存 Evidence 建立整理版本。原版地圖與舊作答不覆寫。

Material requests retain document-global integer handles, page, kind, and exact text under section
titles. Response v5 Claims select whole Evidence handles with `s: [handle, ...]`; character offsets
are not accepted. Native Evidence joins geometrically consecutive lines within a PDF text block or a wrapped
continuation across blocks, respecting heading levels, columns and new list items while preserving
line breaks and bounding boxes. A null meaning reuses the
selected units. Code expands quotes and canonical references; technical-literal protection still
applies, but partial quotations cannot replace a complete meaning.

Page processing policy `native-text-only/v1` uses reliable PyMuPDF text as the sole source
for new Evidence. Images and diagrams remain in the source PDF and are reachable through page
locators; they are not transcribed or sent to the semantic service. Pages without reliable text
are explicitly excluded. A document without usable text fails before semantic inference.
See [document ingestion](document-ingestion.md) for supported inputs and provenance.


Original Evidence remains available. Claim candidates omit explicit copyright text in page margins,
repeated marginal running text, and page numbers consistent with page order across pages. Headings,
code-like text and non-margin content are preserved; an arbitrary bottom crop is not used. Filtered
handles are never renumbered. These rules reduce known citation failures, not prove semantic
support for every retained body-text citation.
Formal `::=` definitions keep their indented bodies and start a new unit at the next definition.
An unsupported literal string `null` is rejected as a Claim; source-backed null terminology and
valid literal-restored content remain supported. Contrast relations retain their proposed endpoint
order so positional explanations stay consistent; reverse duplicates are still removed.

Bundles are packed using the resident tokenizer with the actual prompt and current Concept catalog,
reserving 8192 output tokens within the unchanged 32768-token context. New Evidence per bundle
is bounded to 1536 input tokens without the existing Concept catalog, so longer documents make
incremental progress without forcing their full semantic output into one response. An indivisible
Evidence block may exceed this soft limit if the full request still fits the model context. A truncated response fails;
it does not count as a successful material or trigger additional split calls.
Material generation explicitly pins the existing thinking-enabled template and sampling settings in
the runtime lock; packing and inference use the same template options. Relation instructions retain
supported edges while distinguishing necessary dependencies, concrete uses, and the entities being
compared.

Assessment generates three candidates with the v2 response contract, then makes one bounded batch
check through the same resident Gemma 4 service. The checker receives source Evidence and reordered
options without the proposed answer key. Publication requires a unique selected answer matching
the generator's exact source span, and no duplicate of a prior question. Rewording the same task,
referent and conditions is a duplicate; different requested attributes, referents or application
scenarios can assess the same knowledge. Distractors may occur elsewhere in Evidence.
Code retains exact source binding, option identities, private answers, scoring and idempotency.

The only Relation types are `prerequisite`, `part_of`, `application`, `example`, and `contrast`.
`prerequisite` is the only Relation that can change Initial Path order or create a learner prerequisite
gap. Document Tree placement always comes from document structure.

There is one production Python minor (3.12) and one externally resident
`google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-w4a16-ct` service. Native text is the sole new Evidence source. The backend never starts,
stops, swaps, or unloads Gemma 4. Assessment uses the same authenticated loopback service.
mDeBERTa is removed.

Pre-release persistence is a clean final schema. `knowledge_structures` stores one immutable artifact
instead of parallel material/map artifacts. The credentials migration upgrades the accepted schema
without rewriting stored artifacts.

Account credentials live on `learners`; `learner_sessions` remains the authorization authority.
Registration creates one learner and session atomically. Login verifies the salted scrypt password
hash and issues a new session for the same learner. Logout revokes only that session. Existing
anonymous learners remain intact and are not automatically attached to accounts. All API/PDF
responses are private and `no-store`. The frontend retires its client and unmounts private views on
logout or session expiry; it never creates anonymous identities or replays failed writes under a
new identity. The browser-global latest-material pointer and its consumers are removed.

The material library is a read projection over Material, Artifact, MaterialProcessingRun and
KnowledgeStructure. Materials retain an optional uploaded display name; older rows have a
recognizable date/ID label. Latest attempts and published revisions are listed independently, so a
failed new attempt cannot hide a prior result. Reopen uses existing exact-revision GET endpoints
and creates no learning records. There is no separate material-history store.

Study resume (`study-resume/v5`) projects the bound StudySession, KnowledgeStructure,
AssessmentSet summaries and derived learner progress. The selected set is explicit in the
Study Session URL. Published questions and feedback are read through the selected set, using
its membership and private-answer validators. Reads never create sessions, questions or answers.
Single-question generation/submission/history routes are removed.
Completed-cycle navigation applies the current backend `advance` or `complete` decision through
`POST /v1/study-sessions/{id}/guidance/apply` (`guidance-apply/v2`). The revision is checked under
the shared Material/Study lock; replay cannot advance twice, and active assessments remain protected.
There is no separate preparation page or mastery calculation.

Material creation uses the source collection and revision APIs (`/v2/materials`, sources,
revisions); direct `/v1/materials` POST and `/v1/material-processing-runs` POST are retired.
Public readers accept the current source-aware view/run/library contracts only. Historical
migration files and persisted rows are not deleted or rewritten by this cleanup.

B3-A appends immutable source snapshots and analyzes only added sources, retaining verified prior
Evidence and semantic content. PDFs remain separate, with source-aware reading positions in a v4
KnowledgeStructure. Unchanged, unambiguous Claims can inherit existing answer evidence through the
same learning-state reducer without copying or rewriting AnswerEvents. Valid updates containing new
grounded Claims promote the head, including partial results with quality notices. Cancellation,
processing failures and updates without usable added content retain the previous head. Unreferenced
old structures are pruned, while structures required by saved learning remain readable. See
[source revisions](source-revisions.md) for publication, retention and migration details.

B3-B creates the initial map from one or more ordered, ready sources using the same pipeline.
All uploads enter the source confirmation page before semantic analysis; per-file retries reuse
their upload receipts. Initial source ordering is frozen by the revision request, with no second
KnowledgeStructure schema or merged PDF.

Knowledge Map reads material metadata alongside its immutable structure and run binding. If a study
exists, it reads the small learner-progress response rather than fetching the full StudySession
resume envelope again. Progress and resume share a repeatable-read database snapshot: source-bound
structure validation, study scope, AnswerEvents, assisted evidence and cycle projection are reused
within that read. No global cache replaces owner or source checks.
